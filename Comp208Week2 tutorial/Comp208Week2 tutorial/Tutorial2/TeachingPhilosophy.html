												<h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
												<p>What inspired Me to Pursure Teaching</p>
											</header>

											My name is Bianca Gage and there are many reasons as to why i decided to become a teacher. 
                                            Coming from a second generation import family on both sides with stories of their lives being similar,  
                                            my grandparents had migrated from croatia to Australia to escape the war and persue a better life for 
                                            themselves and their family, they moved with very little money and spoke broken English so it was 
                                            to no surprise the only jobs they could find were in factories, they worked consistently sometimes even 
                                            working 15 hour days to raise a family, they did whatever they could to ensure that there children (my parents) 
                                            could have a better life than one that they had experienced, one way was engraining into my parents the 
                                            importance of education to being successful and finding a quality job later in life. An opportunity that 
                                            they never had. My parents understood the importance of education, passing down this notion to my siblings. 
                            
                                        </p>
                                            I started my educational journey in 2008 at Our lady of Fatima Caringbah and can't remember much from primary 
                                            school but do remember just how much i loved school. I loved learning new things, being with other children 
                                            and being creative. I always tried my best and remember art being my favourite subject throughout my primary 
                                            school life. I wasnt the best at school, but wasnt the worst either i would have classed myself average in 
                                            comparison with other students. I overall really enjoyed my experience in primary school all of my teachers 
                                            were really nice and really inspired me to become a teacher, i loved how they could inspire a classfull of 
                                            students to be the best that they could be and push people to reach their full potential. I best learned when 
                                            i could be creative such as drawing painting or when i could create my own body of work, and often disliked 
                                            doing things that werent creative like maths or science thus i felt most valued and at ease when i could create. 
                                            I can remember one time in year 5 when my art teacher who was one of my biggest role models and inspiration 
                                            to becoming a teacher told me i came runner up for the harmony day art competition and i came straight home 
                                            and was so excited to tell my parents they were so proud of me, and they straight away called their parents,
                                             my grandparents the news that i came runner up for my artwork they too were so proud of me and it made me 
                                             feel so special of how proud i had made them, i didnt even care about the award or not winning i just loved 
                                             how happy i had made both my parents and my grandparents. I was so inspired to becoming a teacher because 
                                             if it was not for my art teacher choosing myself to partake in that competition i probably would have never 
                                             really believed inmyself that i was good at art and being creative and would have wasted my potential. 
                                             However that is really all i can remember from primary school. 
                                            </p>
                                            Highschool however was a completely different story, i started off at OLMC buranneer from 7-10 and then
                                             completed year 11 & 12 at de la salle cronulla. I liked school from years 7-9 because it was still really
                                              chill and we did many creative things in our classes such as art and design and technology, my two favourite 
                                              subjects throughout school. My teachers were always really nice to me at this time and i was always receiving 
                                              awards for academic achievement, and i was still inspired to become a teacher. However during year 10 I was 
                                              simply over school because this was the time that every conversation we had at school was about preparing 
                                              for the hsc I wanted to be able to be creative and think for myself rather than teachers telling me how 
                                              to think, that you had to do an essay like this to get a good mark, you have to do these subjects to get 
                                              a good atar. So at this point i lost a lot of motivation in trying because i was just over the school system 
                                              i never received any awards and my grades dropped from a’s and b’s to predominantly c’s with a few b’s, 
                                              i rarely did my homework and often got detentions for uncompleted homework or talking in class, and 
                                              i was on the verge of dropping out or completing a non atar course simply to get out of school. 
                                            </p>
                                          However the transition to year 11 and twelve at a new school was great because it was a fresh start and i was
                                           able to pick subjects that i was interested in. One of these being design and technology. This was the best 
                                           decision i had ever made as this class was the one class that really encouraged me to get back into education 
                                           and how much i loved learning. My teacher miss gamsaragan was the best teacher anyone could ever ask for she 
                                           was the reason as to why i wanted to pursue a career in design and teachnology teaching, her classes wernt 
                                           normal classes where the teacher teaches a concept and gave out worksheets etc, she was passionate and you 
                                        could tell she loved what she did, she catered to every students needs and had a personal connection to each 
                                        student, she encouraged everyone to do their best and truly believed that everyone in the class could be successful 
                                        and never made anyone feel dumb or that they werent good enough. Something that i want to carry on to when 
                                        i become a teacher i can honestly say that without her i wouldnt have went as good as i did in her class as 
                                        what i did if i didnt have her as a teacher because she was truly an inspiring person to watch teach as she 
                                        just put so much effort into what she did and went above and beyond for each person in the class.
